Sure, here's a brief overview of the five common measures of central tendency in statistics, along with their formulas:

**1. Arithmetic Mean:**

* Also known as the average, it is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values.
* Formula: `Arithmetic Mean = (Σx_i) / n`
* Example: If you have exam scores of 70, 80, 90, and 85, the arithmetic mean is (70 + 80 + 90 + 85) / 4 = 81.25.

**2. Geometric Mean:**

* It is the nth root of the product of all values in a dataset.
* Formula: `Geometric Mean = (√(x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n)) ^ (1/n)`
* Example: For the same exam scores, the geometric mean is (√(70 * 80 * 90 * 85)) ^ (1/4) ≈ 80.6.

**3. Weighted Mean:**

* It assigns different weights to different values in a dataset, reflecting their relative importance.
* Formula: `Weighted Mean = Σ(w_i * x_i) / Σw_i`
* Example: If the exam scores have weights of 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, and 0.2, respectively, the weighted mean is (0.2 * 70 + 0.3 * 80 + 0.3 * 90 + 0.2 * 85) / (0.2 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.2) ≈ 82.5.

**4. Harmonic Mean:**

* It is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the values in a dataset. 
* Formula: `Harmonic Mean = n / (1/x_1 + 1/x_2 + ... + 1/x_n)`
* Example: For the same exam scores, the harmonic mean is 4 / (1/70 + 1/80 + 1/90 + 1/85) ≈ 78.7.

**5. Root Mean Square (RMS):**

* It is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the values in a dataset.
* Formula: `RMS = √((x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2) / n)`
* Example: For the same exam scores, the RMS is √((70^2 + 80^2 + 90^2 + 85^2) / 4) ≈ 82.3.

These are just a few basic examples, and each measure of central tendency has its own strengths and weaknesses depending on the context. Choosing the right one for your analysis depends on the specific data and what you want to learn from it.
